Fake for Seam Devicedb. Use with Fake Seam Connect.

## Description

This module allows you to spin up an in-memory server
for the Seam Devicedb.

## ðŸ““ Notes

### Text Search

Full-text search on real devicedb API (using the `?text_search` parameter) is far more flexible than the simple matching provided by this fake.

### Seeding with Data

This fake can be seeded with data from the live API. To do so, either call `POST /_fake/seed_from_live_api` or use the exported helper:

```ts
import axios from "axios"
import { createDatabase, seedFromLiveApi } from "@seamapi/fake-devicedb"

const db = createDatabase()

// You could create a client that goes through the Seam Connect devicedb proxy instead
const live_client = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://devicedb.seam.tube",
  headers: {
    "x-vercel-protection-bypass": "<secret>",
  },
})

await seedFromLiveApi(db, live_client)
```

### Images

There is a single bundled image available for testing. To test with more images, populate the database using the method described above. The `image_id`s in the fake database will then point to `image_id`s from the live API and requests to the fake's `/images/view` endpoint will proxy through to the live API.
